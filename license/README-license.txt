There are three licenses in this directory.

All code under the org.p2c2e class hierarchy is licensed under the
terms specified by the file "p2c2e-license.txt."

All code under the micromod class hierarchy is licensed under the
terms specifed by the file "LGPL-2.1.txt."

All code under the com.sixlegs.image.png hierarchy is licensed under
the terms specified by the file "lgpl.txt."



In brief:  the org.p2c2e code uses a BSD-type license, which is the
least restrictive of the three.

The micromod code and the sixlegs code use slightly different versions
of the GNU LGPL.

The zag jar file is an archive (not a linked executable; linking is
done at runtime in the Java VM) containing code that falls under all
of these licenses.  Be aware of this if you wish to distribute the jar
file: you are bound by all licenses in that case.
